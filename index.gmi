# Hi

はろー

Hi, I'm tars. An ordinary cyberspace dweller who does programming and such. Technically, I was born and grew up in Japan. (...or I'd love to say grew up on THE INTERNET.)

Languages: Japanese(my mother tongue), eNgLIsh(ykwim? It's eNgLIsh as far as I believe. I have no clue anything about English.)
